## Motivation
In school I graduated in April 2020, I learned HTML, CSS, and JS in relation to web developement. <br/>
However, in practice, I wanted to use a JS library for the UI, and I stumbled upon React.js, which is popular these days (created by Facebook). 
Frequently enjoying Youtube, I have been curious about the algorithm applied to the function of updating and subscribing to videos.
This motivated me to create a personal website by cloning some functions of the Youtube. 
In the project, Node.js is used for the back-end, and React.js is used for the front-end.

## Installation
1. Download ffmpeg and set an environmental path: [How?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjtmgCb8NcE)

3. Open a terminal
4. Go to the root dir
5. Install Node Package Manager --- **npm install**
6. Change the dir to the client --- **cd client**
7. Install Node Package Manager --- **npm install**
8. In the project, go to **server > config** dir
9. Create '**dev.js**' file
10. Put your MongoDB info
11. Save it
12. Open a terminal in the root dir
13. Run Node Package Manager --- **npm run dev**
